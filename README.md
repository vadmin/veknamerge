# veknaMerge 

Simple, attempt #1 at Code extensions "veknamerge". 

## Features

This is a simple extension that takes selected SQL INSERT statement and attempts to create a MERGE statement from it.

## Usage 

select the SQL INSERT statement you want to convert to a MERGE statement and press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type `Convert to MERGE` and press `Enter`.

Or better yet, select the SQL INSERT statement, right click and select `Convert to MERGE`.

## Requirements

Not sure really. See if it runs.

## Known Issues

Does not handle multiple inserts (yet). Maybe I'll get some time later in the week, or weekend to work on it.

## Release Notes

No notes. Just played with it.

### 0.0.1

Initial release of this beast :D
